Craig Buchek
============

Hi, I'm Craig.

## Software

I'm a Staff Software Engineer.
If you're reading this, I'm probably interested in a new opportunity.
[Here's my resume](https://resume.craigbuchek.com).

I specialize in Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
I love Ruby, because it's concise, very readable, and expressive.
Ruby "thinks" the same way I do --- I can almost always guess how it will work.
I can get things done very quickly in Ruby.
Rails extends that to building web apps.

## Presentations

- HTTP workshop
- Booleans

## Open Source



## Long Beach

My wife and I moved to Long Beach in 2020.
Our primary reason for moving was to have a more active lifestyle.
The weather here is great; we're outdoors all the time.
Several times a week, I walk to outdoor yoga on a bluff overlooking the ocean.

## St. Louis

I grew up in St. Louis, and lived there for several decades before moving to Long Beach.
I still have a lot of friends and family there, and visit frequently.

I've been involved in a lot of tech groups in St. Louis:

- STL Ruby
- [STL Tech Slack](https://stltech.org/)
- STL Polyglots
- [STLLUG (Linux)](http://stllinux.org/)
- [SLUUG (UNIX)](http://sluug.org/)
- STL Elm

## Hobbies
